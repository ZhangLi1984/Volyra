App 名称（自创拟人名）： Inklyn


Inklyn is a whispering scribe who breathes life into forgotten memories. In this text-driven fantasy world, you run a mystical sanctum where you craft scrolls of joy, courage, or even precognition. Serve quirky patrons, venture into AI-generated narrative nodes, and engage in strategic turn-based “memory duels.” Every word you write and every choice you make unravels the mystery behind your uncle’s disappearance and thwarts an ancient plot to erase the town’s memories. No complex controls—just reading, thinking, and deciding your path through a deeply immersive story-driven experience.
